# Pi2022

Hello! In this 2022-2023 Pi project i'm going to do an App for windows (and Linux) who is going to use Python and Java.
Here i'm going to upload all my test, programs and progress for this project, also im going to upload all what I've do in the day about the
project.

1st Day:
Today I had done this repository and answered some questions in the classroom. I also oganized my project and I decided that my project will have three part. 1: is do the program who enter in Youtube, search the video and download the video to the computer, I'm going to do the program in Python with the Youtube database for Python. 2: is work in the interface, who have to be easy to use I'm going to do it in Java. 
3: merge the 2 programs in a .exe app (a normal app like Spotify), and for that I'm going to use Auto-Py-To-Exe and idk now, I'm going to search a lot for do that, I think I'm going to use AWS (Database from amazon for comunicate Java with Python) or Jyhton (an another code language who merge pyhthon and Java that is used by IBM).

3rd Day:

Today from home im going to do a scketch about my GUI (app) in paper and then I'm going to do it in Java with Apache Netbeans. Well, after like 6 hours full coding I finally finished my interface writed in Java, I couldn't do to much in Apache Netbeans so i wrote like 100 line of pure code and also learn. I'm going to rest and tomorrow I think I can finish the Pi in 4 days!! Only I have to merge the two programs and decorate more the gui. And that's it.
